Things to improve in the simulator:
    1) Make it clearer what the trust matrix means
    2) Make it so an unsuccessful round has a different trust meaning than a clearly sabotaged round

Ways we can tune the simulation:

1. Number of rounds
2. Threshold for challenge success
3. Cost of mission
4. Rooms impacted per mission
5. Magnitude of trust updates

Analytics we want from the simulation:
1. Win/Loss rate

Ways to improve the room:
1. Implement room caps (to even out volatility in high-player games) (try 4)
2. Adaptive mission scoring
3. Hit the players harder, hit multiple missions
4. Narrative mission style
5. Round scaling (for mission scoring, difficulty)
6. Aim to reduce the win percentage (60/40)
7. Flip all the scores! Start broken, claw your way back up
8. Flips are voted on *after* challenge completion
note: room win/loss is public knowledge
note: have to tap into a room by the end of the timer or you are randomly assigned
note: cap discussion time, but allow people to leave early
note: everyone votes themselves into their own room irl
