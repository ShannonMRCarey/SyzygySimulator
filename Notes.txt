Things to improve in the simulator:
    1) Make it so the team is highly unlikely to ever assign everyone to the same room
    3) for determine_number_to_assign in Player, come up with different logics, eg. refuse to put anyone with <threshold trust in a key room
    4) Make it clearer what the trust matrix means
