Things to improve in the simulator:
    1) Make it clearer what the trust matrix means

Ways we can tune the simulation:

1. Number of rounds
2. Threshold for challenge success
3. Cost of mission
4. Rooms impacted per mission
5. Magnitude of trust updates

Analytics we want from the simulation:
1. Win/Loss rate
